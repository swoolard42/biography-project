            John Adams was born in Braintree, MA on October 30th, 1735. He was a career politician and a founding father of the United States of America. He started as a lawyer in the Boston area. After the Boston Massacre, Adams agreed to defend the British soldiers in the trial. This made him unpopular, but showed is honesty and determination to uphold truth and facts. He was later called to join the Continental Congress and helped oversee the creation of the Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson. During the Revolutionary War, Adams went overseas and joined Ben Franklin in Paris to ask for help. Later he became the vice president for George Washington and then President himself in 1796. He is most known for passing the Alien and Sedition Acts during his presidency. He later lost the next election to his political rival Jefferson. In retirement, Adams lived out of his home Peacefield with his family. Later, he and Jefferson began to write each other letters reflecting on their rivalry and the state of the nation they helped create. they both died on July 4, 1826, 50 years after the creation of the Declaration of Independence.

    <h5>The Boston Massacre</h5>
    <p>After the Boston Massacre, Adams was asked to defend the British soldiers involved in the incident in court. This would have been a very hard choice for Adams, as there had been a rising anti-Britain sentiment rising in the colonies. Despite the risk, Adams wanted to uphold the law and defended them in the trial. This exposed him an unpopular, but radical force in the colonies.
